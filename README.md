Practicing async/promises and using api's with JS.

NOTE: I understand that it is very *very* bad practice to publish my API keys as they can easily be abused by others. However, the API keys used for this project are easily accessible and free, and the focus of this project is to practice promises and the equivalent code using async/await. In the future, I may revisit this project to obscure the API key once I have a better understanding of deployment.
